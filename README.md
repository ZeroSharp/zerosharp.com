# zerosharp.com

Source for **www.zerosharp.com**, **blog.zerosharp.com**, and **about.zerosharp.com** — built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and (eventually) deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

## Local development

```powershell
# from C:\Projects\github\zerosharp
hugo server
```

Then open http://localhost:1313/. Hugo rebuilds on file change with livereload.

If `hugo` isn't on PATH, the binary is installed at `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\hugo.exe` (Hugo extended, v0.161+, needed for the SCSS pipeline). Open a fresh PowerShell — the chocolatey install put it on the Machine PATH.

To produce a static build into `public/` without serving:

```powershell
hugo
```

## Permalinks

The blog section uses `/<slug>/` (NOT `/blog/<slug>/`) so existing
`blog.zerosharp.com/<slug>/` URLs continue to resolve. This is set in `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[permalinks]
  blog = "/:slug/"
```

When writing a new post, set `slug = "..."` in the front-matter and Hugo will emit it at `/<slug>/`.

## Adding a new post

```powershell
hugo new content blog/my-new-post.md
# then edit content/blog/my-new-post.md
```

The archetype gives you `draft = true`. To preview drafts in the local server use `hugo server -D`. Drop `draft` (or set to `false`) when ready to publish.

## Hidden CV

The richer CV that lives at `C:\Projects\ZeroSharp\Website\cv\` has **not** been ported yet. The intent is to host it at a URL that's not linked from anywhere on the site, given out by hand. Wire-up is pending — see CHANGELOG section *Pending* below.

## Hosting

Not yet deployed. Plan: connect this repo to Cloudflare Pages with build command `hugo` and output `public/`. Custom domains:

- `zerosharp.com` (apex) and `www.zerosharp.com` → both serve the landing page
- `blog.zerosharp.com` → also serves the same site, where `/<slug>/` paths give the post pages
- (future) `cv.zerosharp.com` or some private URL → for the rich CV once ported

The same `public/` build is served at all three hostnames; URL paths handle the routing.

## Notes on conventions

- **Line endings.** Repo is currently writing with whatever `core.autocrlf` is set to in your global git config. If you start seeing 200+ "modified" files showing as line-ending churn (CRLF↔LF), add a `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto eol=lf` and re-normalize.
- **Disqus identifiers.** Each ported post sets `disqus_identifier` and `disqus_url` in front-matter to the original `http://ZeroSharp.github.com/<slug>/` so historical comment threads stay attached. Don't drop those.
- **Images.** Octopress's `{% img right /p alt %}` floated images right with text wrapping. The migration script preserves this by emitting `<img class="img-{right,left,center}">` HTML; the SCSS in `_post.scss` does the float + responsive collapse on small screens.
- **Code blocks.** Fenced blocks (\`\`\`csharp) get the dark Solarized frame with traffic-light header via Chroma. 4-space-indented blocks fall back to a plainer dark frame (no traffic lights, no syntax highlighting) — see `_post.scss` `.entry-content pre`.

See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for the architectural rationale and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's been done and what's pending.
